PayPal.pay({
  price: '40.70',
  currency: 'MYR',

  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

### FuturePayment

```javascript
import PayPal from 'react-native-paypal-wrapper';

// Required for Future Payments
const options = {
  merchantName : "Merchant name",
  merchantPrivacyPolicyUri: "https://example.com/privacy",
  merchantUserAgreementUri: "https://example.com/useragreement",
}
// 3 env available: NO_NETWORK, SANDBOX, PRODUCTION
PayPal.initializeWithOptions(PayPal.NO_NETWORK, "<your-client-id>", options);

PayPal.obtainConsent().then(authorization => console.log(authorization))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

// To decrease payment declines, you must specify a metadata ID header (PayPal-Client-Metadata-Id) 
// in the payment call. See docs: 
// https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/mobile/make-future-payment/#required-best-practices-for-future-payments

const metadataID = await PayPal.getClientMetadataId();

This project is inspired by [MattFoley](https://github.com/MattFoley/react-native-paypal) (which does not support both Android and iOS simultaneously, and [shovelapps](https://github.com/shovelapps/react-native-paypal) a fork of the former repo (which we had some problems trying to integrate due to React Native version).
